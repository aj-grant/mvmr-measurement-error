# mvmr-measurement-error

Provides R code to implement a method for multivariable Mendelian randomization which accounts for measurement error on exposures, as described in:

Zhu, Jiazheng, Burgess, Stephen and Grant, Andrew J. (2022). Bias in multivariable Mendelian randomization studies due to measurement error on exposures. [arXiv:2203.08668](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08668)

The functions to implement the method are in mrest_me.R.

The R code to reproduce the primary simulation results and the applied examples from the paper is also provided.
